            <h4>Liability for Contents</h4>
            <p>
                The contents of our pages were created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, 
                completeness, and timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content 
                on these pages according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) under the general laws. According to §§ 8 
                to 10 TMG, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party 
                information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block 
                the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is 
                only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. Upon becoming aware of corresponding 
                infringements, we will remove these contents immediately.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Liability for Links</h4>
            <p>
                Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. 
                Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator 
                of the linked pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were 
                checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at 
                the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable 
                without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any legal infringements, we 
                will remove such links immediately.
            </p>
