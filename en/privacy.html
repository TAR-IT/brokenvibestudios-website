                  We use the Google Tag Manager. The provider is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, 
                  Ireland. The Google Tag Manager is a tool that allows us to integrate tracking or statistical tools and other 
                  technologies on our website. The Google Tag Manager itself does not create any user profiles, does not store 
                  cookies, and does not carry out any independent analyses. It only manages and runs the tools integrated via 
                  it. However, the Google Tag Manager does collect your IP address, which may also be transferred to Google’s 
                  parent company in the United States. The Google Tag Manager is used on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The 
                  website operator has a legitimate interest in the quick and uncomplicated integration and administration of 
                  various tools on his website. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out 
                  exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent includes the storage 
                  of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the 
                  meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time. The company is certified in accordance with 
                  the “EU-US Data Privacy Framework” (DPF). The DPF is an agreement between the European Union and the US, 
                  which is intended to ensure compliance with European data protection standards for data processing in the US. 
                  Every company certified under the DPF is obliged to comply with these data protection standards. For more 
                  information, please contact the provider under <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/participant-search/participant-detail?contact=true&id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active">this</a> link.
